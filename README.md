### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the first lab helped me to understand react components. Lab 4 also helped me with understanding how to fetch from an API and display the data. However, I felt I learned the most from focusing on working on the project and used the labs more as a reference.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would focus more on the styling. I prioritized functionality over styling on the project so I feel there is still a lot of room for growth with the appearance of the website.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Most of my demo went well, such as liking, searching, and sorting playlists. However, I was still in the middle of implementing the trailer to the modal so I was having issues with my modal opening during my demo. Something I noticed in my peers' website was their creativity with how they display information. For example, only showing the title/rating of a movie once the user hovers over it allows the website to look more clean overall. I want to be more creative with my display of information on the next project.

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

For instructors, Thomas was helpful in debugging my code by walking through it with me and guiding me to see where my errors were when fetching from the API to search movies. From my peers, I collaborated well with Ruby. She helped me to understand how to fetch when first implementing the API.
